# Ministry of Testing - 30 Days of AI in Testing
This repository contains a set of exercises prepared for Day 28 of the challenge. 
These are a set of self-contained walkthroughs designed to show how testers can start to build and use AI algorithms in Testing.
These walkthoughs do not require you to write any code but are designed to demonstration what is required to build AI models that you could use to support your testing



# Walkthroughs

## Walkthrough 1: Running Large Language Models Locally
During the challenge a common challenge that has been raised is that of Data Privacy when using online tools such as ChatGPT.
The main concern are that incorporating private information into prompts may lead to private data leaking into future training data.

While applications such as ChatGPT, CoPilot, Gemini are easy to access, it is not the only way that we can leverage Large Language Models.


## Walkthrough 2: Detecting Similarity

## Walkthrough 3: Test Selection and Prioritisation

## Walkthrough 4: Defect Severity Prediction

## Walkthrough 5: Question and Answering using Retrieval Augmented Generation
